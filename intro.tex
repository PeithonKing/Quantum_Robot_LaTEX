% Introduction

    The project primarily focused on learning and understanding quantum circuits. I thoroughly played around with IBM Quantum Experience and Qiskit to build intuitions about Quantum Gates and their uses in Quantum Circuits.

    I read some papers which were provided to me by Prof.\ Panigrahi. Soon I came across the paper~\cite{mahanti2019quantum}. While reading the paper, I came up with two easier solutions to the problem addressed in the paper. My report includes those very solutions.
