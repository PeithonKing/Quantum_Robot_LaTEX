\section {Future Possibilities}

	This is no doubt a very interesting project for beginners on the topic of quantum robotics. It really helps in understanding the quantum mechanics and the quantum computing. But this problem can be solved using classical computers too. Infact in this problem quantum computers don't have much advantage over classical computers. The classical computers are very powerful and can be used for a lot of other purposes. But this problem is very helpful for beginners to learn the topic of quantum computing.

	We might try to use this idea of braitenberg vehicles to build a \textbf{maze solving bot}. This vehicle can be developed to make various sorts of quantum games. This is a simple, yet powerful device and can be used for a lot of other purposes. Imagination is the limit.
